            <h2>The Project</h2>
            <p>This project aims to develop an open-source software tool that supports Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) across all six stages, enabling more efficient analysis of complex sociotechnical systems. 
CWA is a holistic, work-centered framework that examines the constraints that shape human-system interactions.</p>
        <p>While CWA has demonstrated value in designing usable information systems, conducting a comprehensive analysis is time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it entails processing large volumes of qualitative data. 
The software tool will aim to automate the collection, storage, organization, and presentation of data required for each stage of CWA. It will ensure that outputs from each stage are directly usable as inputs to subsequent stages. The tools' internal processes must remain tractable and verifiable. 
</p>
        <p>The software will adhere strictly to the established CWA framework as documented in the open literature, with Lintern (2009) serving as the primary reference. The final deliverable will be a fully functional, well-documented, open-source tool suitable for rigorous usability testing and future evaluation of the CWA framework itself.
